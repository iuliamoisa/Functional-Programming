This repository contains solutions to exercises proposed during the laboratories of the Functional Programming course. 
The course focused on developing skills in functional programming using Haskell, a purely functional programming language known for its strong type system and mathematical approach to programming.

## Technologies Used
- Haskell: The primary programming language used for all solutions.
- GHC: The Glasgow Haskell Compiler used to compile and run Haskell code.
